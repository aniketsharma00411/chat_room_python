# chat_room_python

Following Python modules will be used:

1. socket
2. _thread
3. sys
4. select

Heads up: _select_ module might give some errors in Windows OS so try to use a Linux machine or you can also use Windows Subsystem for Linux by installing Ubuntu for Windows from Microsoft Store(https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/p/ubuntu/9nblggh4msv6?activetab=pivot:overviewtab).

If you face any problems, hit me up with an email at aniketsharma00411@gmail.com and we will try to figure it out together.
